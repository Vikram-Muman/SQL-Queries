This repository contains a collection of SQL queries that I have constructed as part of my current role for ad-hoc analysis and creation of views in Microsoft SQL Server.

The queries demonstrate various SQL techniques, including aggregation functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, data cleansing and transformation, as well as complex joins and subqueries. Each query showcases practical solutions used in real-world business intelligence tasks.
